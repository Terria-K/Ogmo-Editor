This version of Ogmo Editor has __mutated__ to produce hellacious doom-murderscapes with furious performance.


## Changes
Rampant genetic shifts have produced viral abnormalities:

### Apply Tileset to Layer button

This functionality is now relocated a button instead of automatic when switching tilesets in viewer. Chance of destroying tile layers decreased.

### performance improvements

- Much improved rendering times for large maps
- Improved rendering clarity
- Improvements to entity scaling

### more stuff that I can't remember

Features lost in time, like tears in the rain.
